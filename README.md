# DEREK_SONG . Jarvis Consulting

My name is Derek Song, and I am currently working with Jarvis as a data engineer. My role is to utilize Java and Scala programming languages to build applications. I am proficient in Java, Linux, Bash, SQL, RDBMS, JDBC and DAO design pattern. Before that, I have achieved a Master's Degree and Bachelor's Degree in Engineering, and I have strong programming fundamentals and learning skills. Besides, I worked in TS Tech Canada Inc. for three years, where I built very good communication skills and achieved hands-on experience of working with team and contractors. I really enjoyed my work with Jarvis, and I would love to dig much deeper into this area.

## Development Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_derek](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_derek)

- **[Cluster Monitor](./linux_sql)**: This project requires to develop an application to collect server hardware specifications and monitor node resource usages (such as CPU and Memory) in real time, and store data in PostgreSQL database for Linux Cluster Administration Team. 
- **[Core Java Apps](./core_java)**: There are three apps in this project, and they are Grep, JDBC and TwitterCLI. Grep project requires to build an app to search for a text pattern recursively in a given directory, and output matched lines to a file. JDBC project utilizes JDBC to connect Java application and PostgreSql database. TwitterCLI application can create, read and delete tweets from CLI. MVC architecture is invoked to split the application into multiple layers. 
- **[SpringBoot App](./springboot)**: This app allows users to trade stocks on IEX Cloud. SpringBoot app consists of three tiers based on MVC architecutre: Client tier, Application tier and Database tier. Client tier allows users to use HTTP clients to consume the REST, such as postman, curl, or Java. Application tier is a SpringBoot Java program to process data only. Database tier ensures that application data is stored in a database instance to avoid data loss.
